# $memberAddRoles

> Adds roles to a member, returns bool

| Package | Category | Since | Brackets | Unwrap | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ForgeScript | `member` | v1.0.0 | required | yes | `Boolean` |

## Signature

```fs
$memberAddRoles[guild ID;user ID;roles]
```

Arguments are separated by `;`. Optional (non-required) trailing arguments may be omitted entirely.

## Parameters

| # | Name | Type | Required | Rest | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `guild ID` | `Guild` | **yes** | no | The guild to pull member from |
| 2 | `user ID` | `Member` | **yes** | no | The user to add roles to |
| 3 | `roles` | `Role` | no | yes | The roles to add |

### Per-parameter notes

- **`guild ID`** (`Guild`, required): The guild to pull member from. Expects a guild ID. Taken from `client.guilds.cache` — the guild must be cached.
- **`user ID`** (`Member`, required): The user to add roles to. Expects a member ID. Fetched from the guild resolved by the `pointer` argument (usually a leading guild/channel arg) or the context guild.
  - This argument is resolved against a previously resolved argument (its "pointer") or the current context — order of arguments matters.
- **`roles`** (`Role` , rest, optional): The roles to add. Expects a role ID. Looked up in the guild resolved by the `pointer` argument or the context guild.
  - This argument is resolved against a previously resolved argument (its "pointer") or the current context — order of arguments matters.

## How it works

Member functions operate on guild members — roles, timeouts, moderation actions, voice state, properties.

`$memberAddRoles` has `unwrap: true` — every argument is compiled and executed **before** the function body runs: nested `$functions` inside its brackets resolve first, then the resolved values are type-checked (see the parameter notes above) and handed to the implementation. If any argument fails to resolve or type-check, execution of this function stops with a ForgeError and the command aborts (unless the call was silenced with `$#function[...]` or wrapped in `$try[code;catchCode]`).

The `roles` argument is a **rest** argument: every remaining `;`-separated value is collected into a list (possibly empty if not required).

## Examples

**Basic usage**

```fs
$memberAddRoles[123456789012345678;123456789012345678]
```

**Full form (all arguments)**

```fs
$memberAddRoles[123456789012345678;123456789012345678;123456789012345678]
```

## Reference implementation (source)

Taken from `src/native/member/memberAddRoles.ts` in the `ForgeScript` repository — this is exactly what runs:

```ts
execute(...) {
        member ??= ctx.member!
        const d = await member.roles.add(roles, ctx.reason).catch(ctx.noop)

        return this.success(!!d)
}
```

## Quirks & gotchas

1. Brackets are REQUIRED — omitting `[...]` is a compile error ("Function X requires brackets").
2. Discord entity arguments must be 16-23 digit snowflake IDs — usernames, mentions or full URLs are rejected. Resolve names first with the `lookup`-category functions.
3. Universal prefixes apply: `!` to discard output (`$!fn[...]`), `#` to suppress the error alert (`$#fn[...]` — top-level calls only, and the run still aborts), `@[sep]` to return the count of separated output pieces (`$@[;;]fn[...]`).
4. Errors abort the whole command — `$#fn[...]` only hides the alert (on nested calls `#` is ignored entirely); `$try[code;catchCode;errorVar]` is the only real recovery.
