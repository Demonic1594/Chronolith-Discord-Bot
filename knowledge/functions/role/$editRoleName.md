# $editRoleName

> Edits a role's name, returns boolean

| Package | Category | Since | Brackets | Unwrap | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ForgeScript | `role` | v1.0.7 | required | yes | `Boolean` |

## Signature

```fs
$editRoleName[guild ID;role ID;name]
```

Arguments are separated by `;`. Optional (non-required) trailing arguments may be omitted entirely.

## Parameters

| # | Name | Type | Required | Rest | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `guild ID` | `Guild` | **yes** | no | The guild to pull the role from |
| 2 | `role ID` | `Role` | **yes** | no | The role to edit name for |
| 3 | `name` | `String` | **yes** | no | The new name for the role |

### Per-parameter notes

- **`guild ID`** (`Guild`, required): The guild to pull the role from. Expects a guild ID. Taken from `client.guilds.cache` — the guild must be cached.
- **`role ID`** (`Role`, required): The role to edit name for. Expects a role ID. Looked up in the guild resolved by the `pointer` argument or the context guild.
  - This argument is resolved against a previously resolved argument (its "pointer") or the current context — order of arguments matters.
- **`name`** (`String`, required): The new name for the role. Expects plain text. Passed through as-is after inner `$functions` are resolved and `\` escapes are processed.

## How it works

Role functions read and mutate guild roles — creation, edits, position, permissions, member assignment.

`$editRoleName` has `unwrap: true` — every argument is compiled and executed **before** the function body runs: nested `$functions` inside its brackets resolve first, then the resolved values are type-checked (see the parameter notes above) and handed to the implementation. If any argument fails to resolve or type-check, execution of this function stops with a ForgeError and the command aborts (unless the call was silenced with `$#function[...]` or wrapped in `$try[code;catchCode]`).

## Examples

**Basic usage**

```fs
$editRoleName[123456789012345678;123456789012345678;name]
```

## Reference implementation (source)

Taken from `src/native/role/editRoleName.ts` in the `ForgeScript` repository — this is exactly what runs:

```ts
execute(...) {
        return this.success(!!(await role.setName(name, ctx.reason).catch(ctx.noop)))
}
```

## Quirks & gotchas

1. Brackets are REQUIRED — omitting `[...]` is a compile error ("Function X requires brackets").
2. Discord entity arguments must be 16-23 digit snowflake IDs — usernames, mentions or full URLs are rejected. Resolve names first with the `lookup`-category functions.
3. Universal prefixes apply: `!` to discard output (`$!fn[...]`), `#` to suppress the error alert (`$#fn[...]` — top-level calls only, and the run still aborts), `@[sep]` to return the count of separated output pieces (`$@[;;]fn[...]`).
4. Errors abort the whole command — `$#fn[...]` only hides the alert (on nested calls `#` is ignored entirely); `$try[code;catchCode;errorVar]` is the only real recovery.
