# $week

> Returns current week of month

| Package | Category | Since | Brackets | Unwrap | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ForgeScript | `time` | v1.5.0 | none | no | `Number` |

## Signature

```fs
$week
```

## How it works

Time functions parse, format and convert timestamps/durations.

`$week` has `unwrap: false` — its arguments are passed as **raw code text** and are only compiled/executed when the implementation chooses to (this is what allows multi-statement bodies with `;` inside control-flow functions).

This function takes no arguments (none).

## Examples

```fs
$week
```

## Quirks & gotchas

1. Arguments are raw code — nested `$functions` inside them are NOT resolved before this function runs.
2. This function has no brackets — it is used bare.
3. Universal prefixes apply: `!` to discard output (`$!fn[...]`), `#` to suppress the error alert (`$#fn[...]` — top-level calls only, and the run still aborts), `@[sep]` to return the count of separated output pieces (`$@[;;]fn[...]`).
4. Errors abort the whole command — `$#fn[...]` only hides the alert (on nested calls `#` is ignored entirely); `$try[code;catchCode;errorVar]` is the only real recovery.
