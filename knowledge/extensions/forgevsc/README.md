### Configuration

> 🛑 **Deprecated**\
> The custom configuration file was deprecated in **`v1.2.0`**. While it is still supported for backward compatibility, it is now considered legacy. Using extension settings is recommended instead.

You can configure the setup of ForgeVSC by placing a `.forgevsc.json` file inside your workspace root. This config file can be easily generated using the "**ForgeVSC: Create config file**" command.

> ℹ️ **Note**\
> Installed Forge packages are detected automatically. This file may only be needed if metadata fetching fails or you want to change some of the configurations among all various options.

> 💡 **Tip**\
> For more info about an option simply hover over the property key to view a brief description. All properties are optional and can be completely omitted.

---

### Syntax Highlighting
ForgeVSC adds full syntax highlighting support for registered functions. These decorations make Forge code much easier to read visually, especially in larger projects.

> 💡 **Tip**\
> The colors are configurable through the `.forgevsc.json` config file.

---

### Autocompletions
This extension provides autocompletion for Forge functions and enum values while you type. This makes it much easier to discover functions, learn aliases, and write code faster with fewer mistakes.

---

### Diagnostics
Diagnostics validate your Forge code in real-time and report issues directly inside the editor. This helps catching mistakes early while writing rather than during or after runtime.

---

### Hover Info
Shows detailed information when hovering over a function or operator. It also contains useful resources such as links to the source code, documentation, or [guide preview](#guides-sidebar).

---

### Signature Help
Displays function signatures while typing arguments. This is especially useful for keeping track of the current argument and for larger functions with many parameters.

---

### Guides Sidebar
This extension adds built-in support for previewing approved guides from any package. The **Guides** sidebar lets you browse through all guides directly inside Visual Studio Code!

You can also favorite guides to access them quickly from the dedicated **Favorites** section in the "Guides" tab.

---

### Folding Support
ForgeVSC supports folding/collapsing for multiline function contents so large blocks stay manageable.

---

### Inline Bracket Suggestions
Automatically suggests and inserts missing brackets while typing.

When a function accepts brackets, ForgeVSC will suggest `[]` automatically. It also suggests missing closing brackets `]` when you are inside an unfinished function call.

Simply press `TAB` to accept those suggestions.
